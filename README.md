## Highlights:

I'm particularly proud of the structure and reusability of my React components, including dynamic buttons and modular card layouts for each section. To maintain a clean and manageable structure, I organized data into library files using JSON, making updates straightforward.

Each section has its own dedicated CSS file, enhancing maintainability despite the initial styling effort. All sections currently sit within the Home component, but the structure allows easy expansion to multiple pages in the future.

## Future Improvements

Here are several enhancements Iâ€™d like to implement with more time:

- Add Navigation Header:
  Introduce a "Navbar" at the top of the application to help users quickly move between sections and pages.
- ToTopButton:
  Add a "Top" button for easy navigation back to the top.
- Ticker:
  Implement ticker feature at the bottom of the homepage.
- ShowMoreButton (feature added in Feb 2025):
  Include a "Show more"/"Show less" option for the projects section.
- Links (feature updated in Feb 2025):
  Complete link functionality in the intro and contact sections (social media links).
- Images (feature updated in Feb 2025):
  Enhance image styling for a more polished look.
- Project Descriptions (feature updated in Feb 2025):
  Finalize and enrich descriptions to provide better project insights.
