# My portfolio 
This React + Vite portfolio app showcases my projects and frontend development skills.

Focusing on code and responsive style instead of content.

## Highlights:
I'm particularly proud of the structure and reusability of my React components, including versatile buttons and modular card layouts for each section. To maintain a clean and manageable structure, I organized data into library files using JSON, making updates straightforward.

Each section has its own dedicated CSS file, enhancing maintainability despite the initial styling effort. All sections currently sit within the Home component, but the structure allows easy expansion to multiple pages in the future.

## Future Improvements
I'm working on a Version 2 in a black-and-white style. Here are several enhancements Iâ€™d like to implement with more time:

  - ToTopButton: 
    Add a "Top" button for easy navigation back to the top.
  - SeeMoreButton: 
    Include a "See more" option for the projects and articles sections.
  - Ticker: 
    Restore the ticker feature from Version 1 at the bottom of the homepage.
  - Links: 
    Complete link functionality in the intro (image links) and contact sections (social media links).
  - Images: 
    Enhance image styling for a more polished look.
  - Project Descriptions: 
    Finalize and enrich descriptions to provide better project insights.
